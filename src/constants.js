    {index: 1, question: "Is ToDesktop For Me?", answer: "That depends! If you would like to distribute your web app to your users as a downloadable desktop app then ToDesktop is for you."},
    {index:2, question:"Can I try ToDesktop without buying?", answer: "Yes. You can get started by downloading ToDesktop Builder at no cost. After installing it, you can build your desktop application and preview it by clicking the “Run” button. This allows you to test the app on your own computer to ensure it performs to your expectations." },
    {index: 3, question: "Will my app work offline?", answer: "Think of ToDesktop as a normal browser that is just for your website. Your website will work exactly as it does in Chrome, or any other browser."},
    {index: 4, question: "How does my app gets updated?", answer: "Every time your app launches it contacts the ToDesktop update server. If there is a newer version available then it gets downloaded automatically. The user gets a notification that the new version will be installed the next time that they open the app."},
    {index: 5, question: "Do you collect or store data about my customers?", answer: "No. When a ToDesktop app opens it contacts the our servers to check if an update is available. We do not collect or store any user data from these requests."},
    {index: 6, question: "What support do you offer?", answer: "We’ll do our best to help you with any issue you encounter with ToDesktop. You can get in touch with us via email and chat. You can email us at support@todesktop.com or chat with us"},
